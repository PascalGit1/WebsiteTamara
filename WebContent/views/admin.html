				<p class="normalText">I came across this article in a newspaper
					which stated that in 2050 there will be more plastics than fish in
					the ocean. There was this surreal image with the article of a
					seahorse holding on to a q-tip. This was the starting point of
					looking into our oceans and the plastics it contains. A Plastic
					Ocean by journalist Craig Leeson was one of my main resources for
					this work. In the documentary they show us the shocking state of
					our oceans but also some possible solutions to this “plastic soup”.</p>
				<p class="normalText">Although there are already many good
					solutions to help solve the problem, prevention is better than a
					cure. To prevent the problem is to change how we think and behave.
					We need to change the way we consume. Go into a supermarket today
					and buy your groceries, almost everything has plastic around it.
					Not just groceries almost everything we buy contains plastic. We
					buy a product and once we're finished using it we casually throw it
					away. We need to realise that when we throw something away, it
					doesn’t just go “away”.</p>
